# 🧠 DSA-GFG-160-Days-Challenge

Welcome to the **160 Days DSA Challenge** based on the roadmap provided by **GeeksforGeeks**! 🚀  
This repository contains my  progress, code solutions, and learning notes as I solve problems across key data structures and algorithms using **C++**.

## 📅 Challenge Overview

The goal of this challenge is to **master DSA** (Data Structures and Algorithms) step by step in **160 days** with consistent practice.  
Each day focuses on specific topics and handpicked problems from **GFG**, **LeetCode**, and other coding platforms.

## ✅ What’s Inside?

- 📂 Structured folders by day/topic
- 📌 Solved problems in **C++**
- 🧠 Approaches explained in comments (where applicable)
- 🗂️ Covers topics like:
  - Arrays & Strings
  - Hashing
  - Stack & Queue
  - Linked List
  - Binary Trees
  - Graphs
  - Greedy, DP, Recursion, and more...



> ⚡ I’m following the [GFG 160 Days DSA Guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/160-dsa-questions-to-boost-your-data-structures-algorithms-skills/) to keep things on track.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rojinatiwari/DSA-GFG-160-days-challenge.git

2. Open any day/topic folder to view solved problems and their approaches.

3. Run C++ files locally or test in any online compiler.
