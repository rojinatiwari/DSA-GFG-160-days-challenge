// Given a string s of lowercase English alphabets, your task is to return the maximum number of substrings formed, after possible partitions (probably zero) of s such that no two substrings have a common character.

// Examples:

// Input: s = "acbbcc"
// Output: 2
// Explanation: "a" and "cbbcc" are two substrings that do not share any characters between them.
// Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
// Output: 3
// Explanation: Partitioning at the index 8 and at 15 produces three substrings: “ababcbaca”, “defegde”, and “hijhklij” such that none of them have a common character. So, the maximum number of substrings formed is 3.
// Input: s = "aaa"
// Output: 1
// Explanation: Since the string consists of same characters, no further partition can be performed. Hence, the number of substring (here the whole string is considered as the substring) is 1.
// Constraints:
// 1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 105
// 'a' ≤ s[i] ≤ 'z' 


//solution
class Solution {
  public:
    int maxPartitions(string &s) {
        // code here
        int n=s.length();
        vector<int>last(26,-1);
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            last[s[i]-'a']=i;
        }
        int count=0, curr=-1;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            curr=max(curr,last[s[i]-'a']);
            if(curr==i){
                count++;
                curr=-1;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
